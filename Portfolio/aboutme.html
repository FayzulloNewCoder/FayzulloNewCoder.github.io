                <h3>My story</h3>
                <p>Hi, My name is Fayzullo, Since childhood I have huge interesting of languages, I learnt Russian and English in my country, then I wanted learn something different, something difficult. I decided learn Chinese language. I went to China
                    without experience, without friends, without any support. I went there even I didn't know how to say hello in Chinese Language. I afraid of being a foolish that don't even know how to say hello in that language. First day learning
                    Chinese language I didn't understand what teacher said but I learned how to say hello in this language. I thought this is complete win. </p>
                <p>My teacherâ€™s name was Xiu. She every day taught us Chinese during a one year, It was fun, interesting and enjoyable. Even Test and Quizzes were fun. We struggled and tried to get one piece of the candy like a kids even we all students
                    more than 20 years old. After year I got HSK-4 certification and I got to grips with the language. It was tough, but with really good support I developed a real enthusiasm for learning a new language and through that, I learnt about
                    a whole new culture</p>

                <h3>My Work</h3>
                <p>I use a number of teaching techniques in my lessons. One of the most important for me is finding ways to gain attention and to motivate my students. My communicative teaching method is focused on improving communicative competence in English
                    by using techniques where the teacher acts as a facilitator in the classroom, while encouraging students to use the English language as often as possible.</p>
                <p>While my teaching method utilizes resources such as grammar texts and other material to learn basic grammar, I feel that enacting real-life scenarios is the most effective way to teach and reinforce English grammar. English grammar teaching
                    techniques also use grammar exercises that mimic uses of the English language in real-world situations. </p>
